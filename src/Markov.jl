"""
Implementation of algorithms to compute Markov bases. These are necessary
as sets of generators of an ideal for computing Gr√∂bner bases.

Two methods are implemented:
- a simplified method that only works when all data defining an IP is negative
- the project-and-lift algorithm of 4ti2 / Malkin's thesis
